            <p>I'm a designer and illustrator based in Johannesburg, South Africa. I studied Graphic Design for 4 years at the University of Stellenbosch. I am currently working at Platform45 as a senior designer.</p>
            <h3>Designing in a Rails Company</h3>
            <p>In this talk I will run through some of the things I’ve learned while working in this environment and hopefully it will give developers a bit of insight into our design/development relationships and process and how we use Rails as a design tool</p>

            <p>I've been working as a Software Developer for about 9 years now and doing Ruby (and Rails) development for about 4 years. I love to learn new things and am always looking for a new challenge.</p>
            <p>I've been wanting to get into mobile software development for some time now. The possibilities around taking computing away from the desktop, and along with you into your life, really excite me.</p>
            <h3>Rubymotion - iOS and OSX development from a Ruby developer's perspective</h3>
            <p>Rubymotion provides a unique opportunity for those developers looking for an alternative to Objective-C. Start building native applications for the Apple eco-system! This sounds great from a high-level perspective, but there are some caveats that you have to be aware of.</p>
            <p>This talk will be a high level view of:</p>
            <ul class='list'>
              <li>What is Rubymotion?</li>
              <li>Comparing Objective-C code to Ruby, with respect to accessing the various iOS and OSX SDKs.</li>
              <li>The on-going efforts to make Rubymotion development more "Ruby-like".</li>
              <li>The advantages and disadvantages of the various tools available for developing Rubymotion apps.</li>
              <li>Various small demos to show the power of building native iOS apps.</li>
              <li>And some other interesting stuff too :)</li>
